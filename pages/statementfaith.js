  <p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed mb-[15px]">
    Yellow Elm Ministries is a spiritual and religious organization rooted in the sacred traditions of the Divine Feminine. Our faith is expressed through reverence for nature, spiritual embodiment, intuitive wisdom, and communal healing.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed mb-[15px]">
We affirm the following core beliefs:
</p>
<p>
1.	The Divine Feminine is the original source of creation and sacred balance. She is known by many names and faces across time, culture, and spirit, and is honored through our rituals, teachings, and way of life.
</p>
<p>
2.	All of nature is sacred and alive. The moon, seasons, elements, and living Earth are divine expressions of Spirit. We align our spiritual practices with natural rhythms to live in harmony with the cycles of life.
</p>
<p>
3.	Every soul carries the spark of the sacred. Each person is a sovereign vessel of divine light, wisdom, and potential. We affirm the right of all beings to walk their own spiritual path with dignity, clarity, and care.
</p>
<p>
4.	Healing and spiritual growth occur through presence, embodiment, and sacred relationship—with the self, with others, and with the divine. We honor ritual, meditation, intuitive practice, and shared community as paths to balance and clarity.
</p>
<p> 
5.	Sacred leadership flows from service, calling, and wisdom—not hierarchy. We affirm the gifts of priestesses and spiritual tenders who walk the path of devotion and guide others in love, compassion, and sacred duty.
</p>
<p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed mb-[15px]">
6.	Our faith is ever-unfolding. We believe in continuing revelation through dreams, visions, intuition, and the living voice of Spirit. We are a mystic and evolving tradition, rooted in ancient wisdom and open to divine inspiration.
  </p>
