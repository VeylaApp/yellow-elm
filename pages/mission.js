  <p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed mb-[15px]">
    At Yellow Elm Ministries, we are committed to creating a spiritually grounded, earth-honoring intentional community where individuals—especially women and trauma survivors—can reconnect with their divine essence, heal through sacred practices, and rediscover purpose in alignment with nature and the feminine spirit.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed mb-[15px]">
    Through ceremonial living, holistic healing, and compassionate fellowship, we seek to hold space for transformation, resilience, and rebirth. We honor diverse expressions of spirituality and embrace the cycles of the earth, the moon, and the soul as we co-create a sacred path of liberation and restoration.
  </p>

  <p className="text-lg font-inter leading-relaxed">
    Our mission is rooted in love, embodied in service, and expressed through intentional community, sacred counsel, and spiritual sovereignty.
